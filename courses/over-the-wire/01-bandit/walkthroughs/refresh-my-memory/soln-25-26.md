`bandit-25-conn.sh`

### Description
We're starting to get to more complex subjects now.  
This is demonstrating how users can have different shells.  
1. Find the users shell
2. Try the users shell
3. Learn about the users shell
4. Use the sshkey to connect as bandit26 & read their Flag 

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
/usr/bin/showtext
more /usr/bin/showtext
cat bandit26.sshkey 
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -t bandit26@localhost cat text.txt

# Ok from here it gets interesting...
# Since you will get auto logged out after successful login.
# The key lays in the fact that the "shell" is actually just a MORE cmd. 
# Because of this, we can access VIM from the MORE Psuedo shell
# VIM allows us to carry out commands from inside its text editor.

# Step 1 - Make your command shell / terminal application VERY small, no more than 2-3 lines tall. (Windows Terminal/Powershell window/Linux Terminal, etc)
# Step 2 - type "v" in the MORE Psueudo Shell to access VIM
# Step 3 - type `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`
