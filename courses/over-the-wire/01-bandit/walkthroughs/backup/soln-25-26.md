# Ok from here it gets interesting...
# Since you will get auto logged out after successful login.
# The key lays in the fact that the "shell" is actually just a MORE cmd. 
# Because of this, we can access VIM from the MORE Psuedo shell
# VIM allows us to carry out commands from inside its text editor.

# Step 1 - Make your command shell / terminal application VERY small, no more than 2-3 lines tall. (Windows Terminal/Powershell window/Linux Terminal, etc)
# Step 2 - type "v" in the MORE Psueudo Shell to access VIM
# Step 3 - type `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`
