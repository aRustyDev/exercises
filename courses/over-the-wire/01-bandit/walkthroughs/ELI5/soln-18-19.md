`bandit-18-conn.sh`

### Description
This introduces you to how a logon process actually happens.  
They demonstrate how an improperly configured `.bashrc` can lead to issues with logging on. They also show how you can still get around this or do certain actions w/o even achieving an long lived shell. 

1. After connecting, you will have been immediately logged out because of a setting in ~/.bashrc
2. Edit your Login Script to echo out the README file
    ```bash
    ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
    ```
    * If you're using the connection script that I made, then it's commented out there.
