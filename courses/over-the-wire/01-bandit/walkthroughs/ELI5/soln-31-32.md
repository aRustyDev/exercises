`bandit-28-conn.sh`

### Description
Hey guess what, MORE GIT!!
This is trying to get a Flag by commiting a file that shouldnt be committed. (I'm still trying to understand why it works)

```bash
tdir=/tmp/$(date +%s) && mkdir $tdir && cd $tdir
git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo
cd repo
cat README.md
echo 'May I come in?' > key.txt
git add key.txt -f
git commit -m "forcing key.txt commit"
git push
```
**Flag:** '56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e'
