`bandit-09-conn.sh`

### Description   
This is meant to introduce you to the `string` cmd.   
`string` pulls out any human readable strings from files.  
This can be useful for reverse engineering & forensics. 
We then grep for any occurances of multiple `=` & at least 30 characters after (this is the key)
   
```bash
strings data.txt | egrep "=+ .{30,}"
```
