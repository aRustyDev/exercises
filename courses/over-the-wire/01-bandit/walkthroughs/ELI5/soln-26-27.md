`bandit-26-conn.sh`
    * Make sure your terminal window is VERY short (1-3 Lines)

### Description
 Ok from here it gets interesting...   
 Since you will get auto logged out after successful login, the key lays in the fact that the "shell" is actually just a `MORE` cmd. Because of this, we can access VIM from the `MORE` Psuedo shell VIM allows us to carry out commands from inside its text editor.

1. Make your command shell / terminal application VERY small, no more than 2-3 lines tall. (Windows Terminal/Powershell window/Linux Terminal, etc)
2. type `v` in the `MORE` Psueudo Shell to access VIM
3. type `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`

```bash
:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
```
